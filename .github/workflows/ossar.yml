name: OSSAR Scan

# OSSAR scanning workflow for open-source software analysis.  This job
# runs on pushes and pull requests to the main branches.  It runs on
# Windows because the OSSAR action currently requires a Windows runner.
# The results are uploaded as a SARIF artifact.  Adjust the
# directory-to-scan parameter if your project layout changes.
